    title: "How to Prepare CAD Drawings for Metal Fabrication",
    content: `
      Preparing your CAD drawings properly before fabrication saves time, money, and prevents costly rework.
      At RS Metal, we recommend following these best practices:

      â€¢ Export your files in DXF or DWG format for 2D profiles.
      â€¢ Ensure all dimensions are real-world units (millimetres, not pixels).
      â€¢ Avoid duplicate or overlapping lines â€“ they cause cutting errors.
      â€¢ Check hole sizes â€” ensure theyâ€™re large enough for your laser or plasma setup.
      â€¢ Keep text or labels on a separate layer (if needed for engraving).
      â€¢ Verify bend lines and radii align with the material thickness and tooling.

      A clean, well-organised drawing ensures your part is cut with maximum precision and minimal adjustments.

    title: "Laser vs Plasma Cutting: Which Should You Choose?",
    content: `
      Both laser and plasma cutting are highly effective, but they suit different applications.

      ðŸ”¹ **Laser Cutting**
      â€¢ Ideal for thin to medium-thickness materials.
      â€¢ Produces very fine cuts and clean edges.
      â€¢ Excellent for detailed profiles and small holes.
      â€¢ More accurate, but generally more expensive.

      ðŸ”¹ **Plasma Cutting**
      â€¢ Best for thicker steel and aluminium.
      â€¢ Faster and more cost-effective for heavy-duty work.
      â€¢ Edges are slightly rougher but sufficient for structural parts.

      At RS Metal, we help you select the most efficient method based on your projectâ€™s tolerances, finish, and cost targets.
